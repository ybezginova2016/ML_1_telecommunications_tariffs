## ðŸ“¡ **Telecommunication Tariffs: Predicting the Best Tariff Plan**

### **Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the best tariff plan for customers of a telecommunication company. The goal is to achieve an accuracy score of at least 0.75 on the test dataset, ensuring that the model can reliably recommend the most suitable tariff plan based on customer usage patterns.

### **Project Description**
This project involves developing and evaluating various machine learning models to classify customers based on their telecommunication usage and assign them to the most appropriate tariff plan. The focus is on maximizing the model's accuracy while testing its performance on a separate test dataset.

### **Data**
The project utilizes customer data, including their usage patterns, demographic information, and existing tariff plans. The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and used to train and validate the models. Sorry, I cannot find the initial dataset. :(

### **Code**
The complete code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing, can be found in the Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/ML_1_telecommunications_tariffs/blob/main/ML_telecommunications.ipynb).

### **Results**
The model aims to achieve a minimum accuracy score of 0.75 on the test dataset, ensuring its effectiveness in predicting the best tariff plan for customers.
